# Coding Challenges
My collection of Data Structures and Algorithms to solve coding challenges, study and practice.

Data Structures and Algorithms implementations are heavily inspired by the book [_Competitive Programming_](https://cpbook.net) by Steven Halim and by [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org).

Problems can be found at [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/) [[BR](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/pt/)].
