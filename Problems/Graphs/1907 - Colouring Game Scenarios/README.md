# Colouring Game Scenarios

### [Problem description](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1907).

### Solution

Use [Flood Fill BFS](https://github.com/LeonardoNNanci/coding_challenges/tree/main/Algorithms/Graph/Flood%20Fill) to count the number of connected components in the grid. DFS results in Runtime Error, due to the large number of recursive calls.

Python code exceeded the time limit.
