### Solution

Perform a [Breadth First Search](https://github.com/LeonardoNNanci/coding_challenges/tree/main/Data%20Structures/Binary%20Search%20Tree) in which visited nodes are stored in a set and neighbor vertices are defined by the two possible operations described in the problem: [invert the number](https://github.com/LeonardoNNanci/coding_challenges/tree/main/Algorithms/Math/Invert%20Number) and increment 1.
