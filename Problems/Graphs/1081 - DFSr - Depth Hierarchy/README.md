# DFSr - Depth Hierarchy

### [Problem description](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1081).

### Solution

Traverse the graph using [Depth First Search](https://github.com/LeonardoNNanci/coding_challenges/tree/main/Algorithms/Graph/Depth%20First%20Search), controling the depth of the recursive calls.

Print two spaces to represent the depth.

Print the origin and destination vertices of all edges. If the destination has not been visited, print the function call to that edge.

Connected components of size 1, are not printed.
