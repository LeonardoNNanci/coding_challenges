# Binary Search Tree

### [Problem description](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1195).

Implement a Binary Search Tree, then traverse it in pre, in and post order.

In a BST, values smaller than the current node will be found to the left of that node and values grater than the current node will be found to its right.
