# Level Order Tree Traversal

### [Problem description](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1466).

### Solution

Implement a [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/LeonardoNNanci/coding_challenges/tree/main/Data%20Structures/Binary%20Search%20Tree) and traverse it using a customized version of [Breadth First Search](https://github.com/LeonardoNNanci/coding_challenges/tree/main/Algorithms/Graph/Breadth%20First%20Search) for BSTs, starting from the root.
