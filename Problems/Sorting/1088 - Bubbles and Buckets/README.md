# Bubbles and Buckets

### [Problem description](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1088).

### Solution

Use [Merge Sort](https://github.com/LeonardoNNanci/coding_challenges/tree/main/Algorithms/Sorting/Merge%20Sort) to count the number of inversions to sort the array.

[Bubble Sort](https://github.com/LeonardoNNanci/coding_challenges/tree/main/Algorithms/Sorting/Bubble%20Sort) results in time limit exceeded.

Couldn't get an accepted answer in python due to time limit, even with faster input.
