# The Dole Queue

### [Problem description](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1119).

### Solution

Use a circular doubly linked list to represent the circle of applicants, then simulate the process.

In C++, used _std::list_ along with some custom functions to simulate a circular list.

Had a bit of a hard time with indices using _collections.deque_ in Python, so decided to implement the data structure from scratch.
