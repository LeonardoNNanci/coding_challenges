# Interval Product

### [Problem description](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1301).

### Solution

Use a [Segment Tree](https://github.com/LeonardoNNanci/coding_challenges/tree/main/Data%20Structures/Segment%20Tree) to efficiently perform the range product queries and update the values.

Insert only -1, 0 or 1 in the data structure to avoid overflowing the query results.

Couldn't make it in Python due to time limit exceeded, even using fast IO.
