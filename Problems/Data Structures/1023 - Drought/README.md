# Drought

### [Problem description](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1023).

### Solution
Use map/dict to store key-value data, where the keys are the average consumption and the values are the number of residents consuming that average. Accumulate total consumption and total residents to calculate the total average.

For the first time, had to use faster input read in python, due to the large number of residences.
