# Rails Again... Tracing Movements

### [Problem description](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1063).

### Solution

Pretty much the same as [1063 - Rails](https://github.com/LeonardoNNanci/coding_challenges/tree/main/Problems/Data%20Structures/1062%20-%20Rails). But now, for every movement, print the code of the movement and if the configuration is possible.
