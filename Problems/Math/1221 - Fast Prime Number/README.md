# Fast Prime Number

### [Problem description](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1221).

### Solution

Checking if any odd number from 3 to $\sqrt{N}$ divides N is performs fast enough. Even numbers only divide even numbers and 2 is the only prime even.

If N = 2, it is prime.
If N < 2 it is not prime.
