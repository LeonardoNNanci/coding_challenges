# Quicksort - O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Divide and Conquer sorting algorithm.

Gets the value in the middle and divides the array in two:
- the left array contains values smaller than the middle value
- the right array contains values greater than the middle value

Recursively calls quicksort for the left and right arrays until they have 1 or 0 items.
